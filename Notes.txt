_id is a combination of The time stamp+Mac address of the machine+process id of the machine +counter running
time stampfield occupies first4 bytes
mac address occupies the first 3bytes
process id of the machine occupies next 2 bytes
counter running occupies  next 3 bytes
so a total combinatiion of 4+3+2+3 makes 12 bytes the _id

Even we can specify the _id on our own but it should be unique. But if it is not unique it throws a write error
And if you are doing batch processing by using insertMany command if the operation fails because of the duplicate id the all other writes that are expected to happen post to that will fail.

If you want to make the writes happen except for the one with duplicate id we have to specify the parameter {ordered:true} to push all the writes into the database
It supports data integrity-- which means we can't insert 2 documents into db with the same _id.
