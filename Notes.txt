_id is a combination of The time stamp+Mac address of the machine+process id of the machine +counter running
time stampfield occupies first4 bytes
mac address occupies the first 3bytes
process id of the machine occupies next 2 bytes
counter running occupies  next 3 bytes
so a total combinatiion of 4+3+2+3 makes 12 bytes the _id

Even we can specify the _id on our own but it should be unique. But if it is not unique it throws a write error
And if you are doing batch processing by using insertMany command if the operation fails because of the duplicate id the all other writes that are expected to happen post to that will fail.

If you want to make the writes happen except for the one with duplicate id we have to specify the parameter {ordered:true} to push all the writes into the database
It supports data integrity-- which means we can't insert 2 documents into db with the same _id.

//Reading documents in MongoDB

db.collectionname.findOne()--- to return one file
db.collectionname.findOne().pretty() -- for pretty priniting the file on the mongodb console
db.collectionname.find() ---- to return all the documents

We can have a cursor initialized on db.collectionname.find({}) and we can set to a cursor this will be helpful
if cursor.hasNext() -- checks if there are any more values that need to be returned
if it is true it returns the next value by using cursor.next() 
if it is false it returns an error
Batch size will not exceed the maximum bson document size
cursor is automically iterated upto 20 times
the first batch is returned upto 101 documents or of a maximum size of 1MB
the next batches return a maximum size of 4MB
When MongoDB is fetching results from the data base it fetches the data in batches
the batch has a maximum of 101 documents or 1 MB of data
when these 101 documents are displayed to the user it again fetches the data in Batches now at a batch size of 4MB.
Even though it fetches 101 documents by batch and keep in its memory it will display maximum of 20 documents only

Projections
It returns only the fields that are requested by limiting to the items only we want
It reduces the network overhead as the large amount of data that need to be transfered on the distribution is reduced and it increases the processing capability
Projections are supplied as the second command to the find command if we want something only we have to specify that parameter as 1 
so that only the document with that field and _id is returned by default
but if we want some field not to be display we can mark projection as 0 so that except that fields rest of the fields are returned

Comparision operators
$eq,$ne,$gt,$gte,$lt,$lte,$in,$nin
db.movieDetails.find({"tomato.meter":{$gt:60,$lt:100}},{"title":1,"_id":0});

Element operators
$exists,$type-- string value--2

Logical Operators
$and,$or,$nor,$not
$nor--inverse of $or
$and is used to specify multiple specify criteria on the same field
or else we can use the normal find operation without and
$exists is used to match all those documents where certain parameter exists in those documents
