Which of the following statements are true about choosing and using a shard key? Check all that apply.
MongoDB cannot enforce unique indexes on a sharded collection other than the shard key itself or indexes preferred by the shard key.
The shard key must be unique.
There must be an index on the collection that starts with the shard key.
You can change the shard key on a collection if you desire.
Any update that does not contain the shard key will be sent to all shards.

    Mongo can not enforce unique indexes on a sharded collection other than the shard key itself.

Correct.

    For sharded collections these unique indexes cannot enforce uniqueness because insert and indexing operations are local to each shard.

    Any update that does not contain the shard key will be sent to all shards.

Correct. Mongos will not be able to determine which shard contain all the related entries.

    You can change the shard key on a collection if you desire.

Incorrect.

    Shard keys are immutable and cannot be changed after insertion. See the system limits for sharded cluster for more information.
