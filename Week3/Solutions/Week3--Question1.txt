When using find() in the Node.js driver, which of the following best describes when the driver will send a query to MongoDB?

When a cursor's sort() method is called
When a cursor's skip() method is called
Only when forEach is called
When we call a cursor method passing a callback function to process query results
When find() is called
When a cursor's limit() method is called
When a cursor's project() method is called

Answer: --- "When we call a cursor method passing a callback function to process query results"

Rather than calling a asynchronus call back it is better to call in a synchronous callback and process by iterating using the cursor
