First load the collection into the database on Windows machine by using the command
Open command prompt then type the following command
mongorestore -d m101 -c movieDetails "path to the movieDetails.bsonfile"
Example :- mongorestore -d m101 -c movieDetails "C:/Users/HP15/Desktop/M101JS/movieDetails.bson"

Using the video.movieDetails collection, which of the queries below would produce output documents that resemble the following. Check all that apply.

NOTE: We are not asking you to consider specifically which documents would be output from the queries below, but rather what fields the output documents would contain.

{ "title" : "P.S. I Love You" }
{ "title" : "Love Actually" }
{ "title" : "Shakespeare in Love" }

Options:-
db.movieDetails.find({title: ""}, {title: 1})
db.movieDetails.find({title: "Muppets from Space"}, {title: 1})
db.movieDetails.find({year: 1964}, {title: 1, _id: 0})
db.movieDetails.find({}, {title: 1, _id: 0})
db.movieDetails.find({}, {title: 1})
db.movieDetails.find({}, {title}) 

Answer:-
As in the projection if we won't specify _id:0 explicitly it is returned by default
So the answer should contain those where _id:0 is present
so answers are db.movieDetails.find({year: 1964}, {title: 1, _id: 0}) and db.movieDetails.find({}, {title: 1, _id: 0})

I think it's not rocket science :D
