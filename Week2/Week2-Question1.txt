Coming to the question
Question 1 

Which of the choices below is the title of a movie from the year 2013 that is rated PG-13 and won no awards? Please query the video.movieDetails collection to find the answer.

NOTE: There is a dump of the video database included in the handouts for the "Creating Documents" lesson. Use that data set to answer this question.

Options:- 
A Decade of Decadence, Pt. 2: Legacy of Dreams
Thor: The Dark World
Evil Dead
Iron Man 3
Saving Mr. Banks
World War Z
Journey to the West
Escape from Planet Earth
Man of Steel
A Tribute to J.J. Abrams 

Answer :- A Decade of Decadence, Pt. 2: Legacy of Dreams

Approach:-
first know the structure of any document in movieDetails collection by using db.movieDetails.findOne()

Then as per the question 
execute the following command
db.movieDetails.find({"year":2013,"rated":"PG-13","awards.wins":0},{"title":1,"_id":0})
as awards is an object and it contains the wins you have to get wins by using awards.wins same as in Javascript
As we want to know only the title of the movie only we need a projection to get answer directly :D
