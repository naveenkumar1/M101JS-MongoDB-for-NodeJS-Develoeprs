Suppose you wish to update the value of the "plot" field for one document in our "movieDetails" collection to correct a typo. Which of the following update operators and modifiers would you need to use to do this?

Options:-

$each
$rename
$set
$slice
$position
$push
$sort
$addToSet
$unset 

Answer: - $set
You'll go with  the correct answer if you haven't read the documentation
But if you read the documentation you'll go wrong with this question.Even I went :'(

As it is mentioned in the question it is to correct to a typo it is $rename

If you are not aware of $rename 
$rename does the changing of the key name I thought key may be the wrong 
Probably I'm a big idiot :(
